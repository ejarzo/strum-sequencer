The [Strum Sequencer](https://strum-sequencer.netlify.app/) is a sequencer that you play by ‘strumming’ 8 lines. Each line is set to a note in the scale, indicated by the column of circles. I initially wanted to make a new way of adding rhythm to a melody, but was also interested in exploring how melodies sound in relation to notes in the scale. The square buttons on the side allow you to select a note to play on a loop in the background. Experimenting with this setup allows you to get a better understanding of the “feel” of different notes in a scale — for example, the same melody played over the root sounds much different than over the 6th. It also lets you change key and scale which helps showcase how the different scales sound in relation to each other.
